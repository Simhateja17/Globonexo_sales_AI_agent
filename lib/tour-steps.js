/**
 * The guided product tour.
 *
 * This is no longer a screen-by-screen narration. The first six steps are a
 * setup arc: they take the customer through the real actions that get a first
 * campaign live (connect email, set availability, review the campaign that
 * onboarding already built, launch it), gated on the same server-derived
 * completion the Setup Checklist reads. A step's Next does not unlock until
 * the underlying record actually says done. Everything after launch is a
 * shortened orientation to the rest of the app, since by then the customer is
 * live and just needs to know where things are.
 *
 * Each step names the `route` it should be viewed on and a `target` selector
 * that exists on that page. The overlay navigates to the route first, waits
 * for the page to finish rendering, then spotlights the real element. A step
 * can set `dynamicRoute: "onboardingCampaign"` to instead open the actual
 * campaign onboarding built (falling back to `route` if that campaign can't
 * be resolved yet). `requiresStepId` names a Setup Checklist step id. Next
 * stays disabled until that step's server-derived status is "complete".
 * `skippable` steps offer a "Skip for now" action that marks the underlying
 * checklist step skipped instead of forcing it.
 *
 * When a target never appears (slow data, an empty state that renders
 * differently, a narrow viewport) the step degrades to a centred card so the
 * explanation still lands.
