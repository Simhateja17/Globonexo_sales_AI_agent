  {
    q: "What is an AI voice agent for sales?",
    a: "It is software that places outbound calls and holds the conversation itself — introducing the offer, running discovery, handling objections, and booking a meeting. In GNX Sales, each voice campaign gets its own agent built from that campaign's product description, value proposition, pain points, objections, and tone.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know the agent will not embarrass me on a call?",
    a: "Before a campaign can dial, the agent is run through ten adversarial scenarios with explicit pass and fail conditions — the busy prospect, the skeptic, the wrong person, a do-not-call request, a failing calendar tool, and a caller pushing it to invent customers or pricing. Every transcript is scored, and a campaign that fails can be fixed and re-run.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to buy a phone number?",
    a: "No. A calling number is provisioned for you automatically. There is no telephony account to set up and no separate carrier bill.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can it book meetings during the call?",
    a: "Yes. Calendar availability and booking are live tools the agent can call mid-conversation. The backend computes open slots and the agent offers only those, so it can never invent a time, and a database constraint makes double booking impossible.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens on a do-not-call request?",
    a: "The call ends immediately — acknowledgement, no persuasion, no one more question, no retry. Do-not-call is also checked before dialing, on its own gate separate from email suppression.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does outbound AI calling cost extra?",
    a: "No. Voice and email draw from the same credit pool on every plan. What scales with the tier is how many voice campaigns you can run at once.",
  },

            Handing an AI voice agent a phone number and your prospect list is a real risk. So before an outbound
            AI calling campaign can go live, the agent is run through a set of adversarial calls and scored on
            every transcript.

              information, customer results, pricing, or integrations — and stays concise and non-pressuring throughout.
