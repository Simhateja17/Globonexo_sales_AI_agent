            The real risk with AI outreach is not a clumsy sentence. It is a confident, fluent message about
            something that was never true — sent under your name, to someone you wanted as a customer.

              It does not skip validation, suppression, or the send-time eligibility checks. Every message still
              passes the same pipeline — and a lead who replied, unsubscribed, booked, or asked not to be
              contacted is re-checked at the last possible moment before anything sends.
