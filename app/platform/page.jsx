  },
  {
    q: "Is this lead generation software or an outreach tool?",
    a: "Both. Lead sourcing, enrichment, and qualification happen inside the same product that writes and sends the outreach, so the agent writing a message already knows everything that was learned about that person while finding them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to bring my own lead list?",
