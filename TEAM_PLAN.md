# Globonexo Sales AI — Team Implementation Plan

**Launch Date:** July 20, 2026  
**Team:** Manasa (AI + voice), Poojitha (data + campaigns + frontend), Simha Teja (reviewer)  
**Document Status:** Locked

---

## 1. Team & Ownership

**Rule:** Each module is owned by exactly one person — no shared module ownership. This prevents confusion and keeps accountability clear.

**Cross-training:** Both Manasa and Poojitha work across frontend and backend (≈50/50 split), but each owns complete modules end-to-end.

### Modules

| Module | Scope (Frontend + Backend) | Owner |
|--------|---------------------------|-------|
| **Auth** | Login, signup, forgot-password pages + Express auth APIs + Supabase Auth integration | Manasa |
| **Onboarding** | 3-step onboarding wizard + onboarding API + agent config creation | Poojitha |
| **Landing / Marketing** | Landing page, pricing, terms, privacy | Poojitha |
| **Dashboard** | Dashboard UI + dashboard KPI API | Poojitha |
| **Campaigns + Leads + Apollo** | Campaigns UI, prospects table, Apollo search, CSV upload + campaigns API, Apollo client, CSV import | Poojitha |
| **Gmail + Email + Inbox** | Gmail connect, email sequences, inbox UI + Gmail OAuth, email send worker, inbox polling, reply handling | Poojitha |
| **Meetings** | Meetings UI (static/mock fallback for v0.1) | Poojitha |
| **AI Engine** | Azure OpenAI client, email generation, reply drafting, voice prompt generation | Manasa |
| **Voice / Retell** | Voice campaign UI + Retell agent setup, outbound calls, webhooks, call history | Manasa |
| **Analytics** | Analytics charts UI + analytics API | Manasa |
| **Billing / Stripe** | Pricing page, billing settings UI + Stripe Checkout, Customer Portal, webhooks | Manasa |
| **Settings** | Settings UI + settings API | Manasa |
| **Admin + Support** | Admin panel, support chat UI + admin APIs, support ticket APIs, Supabase Realtime | Poojitha |
| **Infrastructure** | Express scaffolding, Supabase schema, Redis/BullMQ setup, deployment scripts | Manasa |

### Summary

- **Manasa:** Auth, AI Engine, Voice/Retell, Analytics, Billing, Settings, Infrastructure.
- **Poojitha:** Onboarding, Landing/Marketing, Dashboard, Campaigns/Leads/Apollo, Gmail/Email/Inbox, Meetings, Admin/Support.
- **Simha Teja:** Architecture review, PR reviews, scope enforcement, go/no-go decisions.

## 2. Project Structure

**Two separate Git repositories.**

### Frontend Repo: `globonexo-frontend`

```
globonexo-frontend/
├── app/                      # Next.js App Router
├── components/               # React components

├── public/
├── .env.local.example
├── package.json
├── next.config.mjs
└── README.md
```

### Backend Repo: `globonexo-backend`

```
globonexo-backend/
├── src/
│   ├── config/               # Env, constants
│   ├── routes/               # API route handlers

├── ecosystem.config.js       # PM2 config
├── .env.example
├── package.json
├── API_CONTRACT.md
└── README.md
```

### Docs Location

PRD and team plan live in the **backend repo** (`globonexo-backend/PRD.md`, `globonexo-backend/TEAM_PLAN.md`) because the backend owns the data model and API contract. Frontend repo links to them.

**Structure references:**
- Frontend structure: `FRONTEND_STRUCTURE.md`
- Backend structure: `BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md`


## 3. Frontend Refactoring Notes

The existing prototype (`frontend/components/GlobonexoPrototype.jsx`, 2,828 lines) contains the full visual UI but is **not production-ready**.

### What Exists
- Landing page, auth screens, 7-step onboarding, app shell, dashboard, AI agent chat, prospects, pipeline, campaigns, inbox, meetings, analytics, billing, settings.
- All styling in `globals.css`.
- Hardcoded demo data everywhere.

### What Poojitha Must Do
1. **Split the monolith** into pages and reusable components:
   - `app/page.jsx` → landing
   - `app/(auth)/login/page.jsx`, `signup/page.jsx`, `forgot/page.jsx`
   - `app/(app)/dashboard/page.jsx`, `campaigns/page.jsx`, `leads/page.jsx`, `inbox/page.jsx`, `calls/page.jsx`, `analytics/page.jsx`, `settings/page.jsx`, `billing/page.jsx`, `admin/page.jsx`
   - Shared components in `components/ui/`, `components/layout/`
2. **Remove design-tool code**:
   - Delete the `TweaksPanel`, `useTweaks`, and all tweak-related code at the bottom of `GlobonexoPrototype.jsx`.
3. **Simplify onboarding** from 7 steps to 3 steps (reuse existing step components).
4. **Update Settings** to match locked v0.1 decisions:
   - Remove LinkedIn/SMS channel toggles.
   - Add "Auto-approve AI replies" toggle.
   - Add daily email send cap slider.
5. **Add state management** (React Context or Zustand) for auth and org data.
6. **Add API client** (`lib/api.js`) with credentials included for cookie-based auth.
7. **Add loading/error states** to all screens.
8. **Install dependencies**:
   - `axios` — API calls
   - `date-fns` / `date-fns-tz` — timezone logic
   - `posthog-js` — analytics
   - `@stripe/stripe-js` — Stripe Checkout
   - `zustand` or use Context — state management

---

## 4. Development Workflow

1. **Git:** Two separate repos:
   - `globonexo-frontend` (Poojitha owns)
   - `globonexo-backend` (Manasa owns)
2. **Branching:** Feature branches → PR → review → merge to `main` in each repo.
3. **Frontend deploy:** Vercel auto-deploys `globonexo-frontend/main`.
4. **Backend deploy:** Run `deploy.sh` from `globonexo-backend` local clone to GCP VM.
5. **API contract first:** Backend API changes must update `API_CONTRACT.md` before frontend consumes them.
6. **Daily standup:** 15 min sync (time TBD by team).
7. **Review:** Every PR needs Simha Teja approval before merge.
8. **No direct pushes to main.**

---

## 5. Day-by-Day Plan

> Each task has a checkbox. Manasa and Poojitha check off items as they complete them. Simha Teja reviews at the end of each day.
>
> **Module ownership rule:** A single module is owned by exactly one person. No shared modules.
>
> See `FRONTEND_STRUCTURE.md` and `BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` for exact file locations.

## 12. Scope Escalation Rules

If any task threatens the timeline, escalate to Simha Teja immediately. Default cuts (in priority order):

1. Cut pipeline board polish.
2. Cut meetings calendar polish.
3. Cut advanced analytics charts.
4. Cut AI agent chat screen.
5. Cut admin panel advanced features.
6. Cut voice manual mode (keep AI mode only).
7. As last resort: defer voice to v0.2 and launch email-only.

**Nothing new gets added without removing something of equal size.**
